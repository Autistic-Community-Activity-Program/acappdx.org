        The year-round PROJECTS Program grew from ACAP's previous, summer-camp-only, Mentor Program. Collaborating with our partner organization, Community Workshop, young adults research and explore activities and ideas they are most passionate about. With one-to-one guidance, they develop long-term projects as well as participate in community activities, all focused on continued development of creative, social, and professional skills.

          ACAP History

      <p class="mt-5 ">
        The Autistic Community Activity Program began in 1987 as a grassroots effort by parents and supportive professionals seeking to fill an unmet need. They were searching for a summer community activities program and day camp for their children with autism, but found none.

        "Overall, I believe ACAP is the perfect place where kids on the spectrum are accepted for exactly who
        they are and where they are, while at the same time, being gently pushed past their comfort zones to
        experience the next steps towards the growth they need to become more self-sufficient."

        "[Our child] had a wonderful summer, thanks to your program. You kept him plenty busy, out of the
        house,
        away from his games and the computer and on his feet, which he so desperately needs."

        "We would especially like to compliment your staff on the excellent support they provide for their
        campers with autism. The daily visual schedules, their ability to adapt and work with our daughter's
        communication system, and the staff's overall enthusiasm for the campers and each other helped our
        daughter participate to her fullest potential. She is now visibly excited whenever she sees a Tri-Met bus
        because of all the fun places she got to go with your program this summer."
